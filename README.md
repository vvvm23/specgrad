# (Unofficial) PyTorch Implemention of "SpecGrad: Diffusion Probabilistic Model based Neural Vocoder with Adaptive Noise Spectral Shaping"

> Thanks to Microsoft's implementation of
> [PriorGrad](https://github.com/microsoft/NeuralSpeech/tree/master/PriorGrad-vocoder),
> which I use as a base of this implementation.

## Setup
`TODO`

## Usage
`TODO`

## Configuration
`TODO`

### TODO:
- [ ] Refactor model code copied from PriorGrad
- [ ] Dataset preprocessing to support extra precomputed components of SpecGrad (TF-filter per input)
- [ ] Configuration system
- [ ] Basic training script
- [ ] Basic inference script (w/ HF schedulers)
- [ ] Data parallel training (w/ HF accelerate)
- [ ] Optimisations

### Potential Future Features
- Progressive distillation for fast sampling?
- Conditioning methods? (speaker embeddings)
- Larger dataset test?
- Explore other filter designs?
